### JSON data chosen
I used:
-data-restaurant.js data out of the four data sets given.


### Brief description of web page developed (~150 words)
Describe your web page here. In your description, focus on how it works - and what the TA should do to test your web page's functionality. If you had to make any assumptions, write your assumptions here as well (if it goes over 150 words, it is okay).

* This webpage is all about displaying the given data in a table and to apply the filter option in JSON format.

* In order to check the functionality following things should be done:
    - Check if JS is linked properly
    - If the data is displayed in table in JSON format
    - Type the DishId in search bar to check if data is filtered or not
    - If the user inputs something different from DishId nothing would be displayed
    - Also check if user needs to input full DishId or jus 2-3 characters
    - At last, test if mobile view is applied properly or not

* Assumption:
    In mobile view, the user must understand that the scroll button is displayed at the end of table
